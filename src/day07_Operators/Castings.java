/*
  1.create a class named Castings
  1.1 declarae a variable of float named averageScore and initiliaze it to 20.5
  1.2 declare the following variables and assgn to averageScore to each of them

                    byte num1 ;
                    short num2,
                    int num3;
                    long num4;
                    float num5;
                    double num6;


    NOTES:  implicit casting : casting the smaller type to larger type
            explicit casting : casting the larger type to smaller type
  explicit casting is the only way to assign to a larger type primitive to a smaller type through the explicit casting
  even for the nonprimitives the concept is the same
     FOR FLOAT (NUM4) AND DOUBLE (NUM5) OUTPUTS ARE DECÄ°MAL NUMBERS.>>>>20.5

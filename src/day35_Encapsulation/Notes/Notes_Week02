        System.out.println("10 / 3 : "+ 10/3);
        System.out.println("10 / 3.0 : "+ 10/3.0); // 3.0 = double data type
        System.out.println("10 + 3 : " + 10 + 3); // 10 + 3 : 103  concatination: String + int = String  "10 + 3 : "+10 = "10 + 3 : 10" ---- String + int = String
        // which operations come first in JAVA
        // paranthesis comes first, division, multiplication is before concatination

    // IMPORTANT : JAVA Runs from top to bottom and left to right

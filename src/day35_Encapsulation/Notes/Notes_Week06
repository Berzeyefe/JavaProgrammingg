- for loop : repeatable if statement

***** Only gets executed if the condition is true. ***********

     for (initialization; Condition ; Iteration ) {
     statement
     }

     initialization : starting point

     Condition : ending point, created based on initialization

     Iteration: co-related to Condition. MUST be capable enough to make the condition false

    { } curly braces are blocks in JAVA

    Omer: Can someone from Europe work a company in USA or Canada from home as a SDET? And Why the first letter of "String" is capital letter if we look at the other variables they have all small letters?
  we have primitives: int,long,double,char...etc
  String is not primitive, it is Object Type Variable
  String str = "Java"; we are creating an object

  Topics: While & Do-While Loops

  package name: day17_While_DoWHile

  warmup tasks:
  	1. Write a program that can return the frequency of a char from a String

  			Ex:
  				str = "AAABBBC"
  				ch = 'A'

  			Output:
  				3


  	2. write a program that can return the frequency of the a word Java from the sentence

          Ex:
              sentence = "JavaJavaJava";

              output: 3


             	Str = "JavaJava";

             		substrings:
             			1. Java  //substring(0, 4)
             			2. avaJ  //substring(1, 5)
             			3. vaJa  // substring(2, 2+4 )
             			4. aJav  // substring(3, 3+4)
             			5. Java  // substring(4, 4+4)



          	Str = "Java Java Java Python"

          		Delete 1st Java:
          				" Java Java Python"

  				Delete 2d Java:
  						" Java Python"

  				Delete 3rd Java:
  						"  Python"




  while loop: repeated if statement

  	while(condition){
  		statement;
  	}


  do -while : JUST DO IT

  		do{
  			statement;
  		}while(condition);


  branching statements:
  			break statement: exits the loop & switch
  			continue statement: skips the current iteration



  Task:
  	1. Write a program for the  marriage proposal program asking the user, "Will you marry me?"
      if the answer is yes, print "Congrats."
      if the answer is no, print "Goodbye"
      if the answer is neither yes nor no, print "Invalid answer, please re-enter" and repeat it until the user enters either yes or no


      2. You are writing a code for the log-in function of the Cybertek Application, assume that your credentials are:
                      username: Cydeo
                      password: Cydeo123

          Ask the user to enter their credentials.
                  If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in."
                  If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials and if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is locked."

         package name: day18_Nested Loop

         warmup tasks:
                 1.  Write a program that can divide two positive numbers without using / (division) and * (multiplication) and % operators

                                 20 / 6 ==> 3 with the reaminder of 2


                                 a = 20
                                 b = 6;


                                 a -= b;  // a = 14
                                 a -= b;  // a = 8
                                 a -= b;  // a = 2

                         Ask the user to enter their credentials.
                                 If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in."

         Nested loop:  loop inside another loop (inner & outer loops)

                 one iteration of the outer loop, executes all the iteration of the inner loop




         1. Print the following shape by using a nested Loop:
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *
                  * * * * * * * * *


         2. Write a program that asks user to enter a numnber , and check if the number is odd or even.
                 if it's odd, print "Odd Number"
                 if it's even, print "Even number"

                 Ask the user "Would you like to enter another number"
                         if user enters yes, repeat the previous steps
                         if user enters no, print nothing

                         If user enteres invalid answer, repeat the previous steps
